This assignment requires the development of a software architecture, in c++ language, using ROS operating system to drive a robot around a particular environment. The software relies on move_base and gmapping packages for localizing the robot and plan the motion.
The architecture should be able to get the user request and let the robot execute one of the following behaviours:

* Autonomously reach a x,y coordinate inserted by the user

* Let the user drive the robot with the keyboard

* Let the user drive the robot assisting them to avoid collisions
