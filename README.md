### RT2 First assignment ###
This Repository is divided in thre different branches. Only two of them regard the assignment:
* **noetic**: The one used for the third assignment of RT1, in which we can found all the documentation of the project;
* **Third_Assignment_Notebook**: It contains the notebook of the first assignment. In the folder launch under the name of "jp_launch.launch" there is the launch file which can be used to launch the simulation.
